To make delicious little golden fries, you will need : 
1. Potatos
2. Oil
3. Red chilli powder
4. Turmeric
5. Salt


Method : First peel the potatoes and chop them into little pieces. Then soak them in water for about 5 mins. After that, fry them in a pan with adequate oil. Keep mixing the potatoes constantly throughout the procedure. Add a little amount of red chilli powder, enough to subtly cover each individual potato. The flame should be at the lowest throughout, as the idea is to gently heat them for a long fry to reach the maximum crispiness and taste. Add  half a tsp of turmeric powder to cover all the pieces. 
Now let them fry for sometime until their exteriors create a crispy crust/layer. Add sufficient salt and more red chilli powder according to your preference. Let the potatoes fry for some more time, absorbing all the flavor. Then take them off the flame and let them cool for a while. And there you have it, tasty golden little fries that will water your mouth.
